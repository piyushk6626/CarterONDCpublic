## What is Our Approach?
Our mission is simple: enable sellers to onboard the ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) network and create digital inventories effortlessly, even for those who are not tech-savvy. We aim to remove barriers by leveraging cutting-edge AI and intuitive design.

### Key Elements of Our Approach:

#### User Interface:
We use WhatsApp as our primary interface, supported by natural language processing powered by large language models (LLMs). This ensures a familiar, user-friendly experience for sellers.

#### Self-Onboarding:
Sellers can onboard themselves by simply sending the required data to the bot. We handle the submission to the relevant authorities for approvalâ€”no middlemen, no associations.

#### AI-Driven Catalogue Creation:
Using an army of AI agents, we help sellers create their digital catalogues directly via WhatsApp. Sellers only need to upload product details and photos, and the agents do the rest.

#### Easily Discoverable Products:
By generating AI-driven product descriptions from user-provided photos and data, we create vector embeddings based on semantic meanings. This ensures products are highly discoverable across the ONDC network.

## Why WhatsApp?
We chose WhatsApp as our consumer-facing platform after conducting extensive field studies in markets across India. Our research included Tulshibaug, an iconic market in Pune (Tier 1 city), and Ganj Golai, a bustling market in Latur, Maharashtra (Tier 3 city).

### Field Study Insights:
- Smartphone Penetration: Over 95% of respondents had access to a smartphone
- Most Used App:
  - WhatsApp: 90%
  - Facebook: 10%
  - Others: 40% (e.g., Hotstar, gaming apps)
- WhatsApp Familiarity: Almost everyone knew how to use WhatsApp

### Why WhatsApp Works:
- Ubiquity: Almost everyone uses it, regardless of tech proficiency
- Ease of Use: Requires no additional learning for sellers
- Trust: Sellers trust WhatsApp to handle their data
- Multilingual Support: Sellers can type in any language, breaking language barriers
- Natural Language Understanding: By leveraging generative AI, we ensure seamless communication and avoid the frustrations of outdated chatbots
- Minimal Human Intervention: AI agents automate most tasks
- Low Cost: An affordable solution for sellers and the platform alike

## Onboarding Customers
We identified four major store types in traditional markets, such as Palika Bazaar:
1. Fashion Shops
2. Art and Craft Stores (including Accessories)
3. Kirana Stores (Packaged Food)
4. Sweet and Snack Shops (or Restaurants)

### Onboarding Steps:
Sellers are prompted to upload documents and provide legal information based on their store category.

#### General Requirements:
- Name
- Date of Birth (DOB)
- PAN Card
- GST Number
- Address
- Business Name
- Trade License
- Udyam Registration
- Bank Account Number and IFSC Code
- UPI ID
- Phone Number

#### Category-Specific Requirements:
- FSSAI license for food-related businesses

Once the seller provides the required details, the bot automatically submits them to the relevant authorities for approval, ensuring a seamless onboarding process.

## Creating Inventory

### AI Agent for Adding Inventory:
This AI agent is specifically designed to assist sellers in adding inventory by interacting conversationally. It guides the seller to provide crucial details like the product description, price, and quantity. The agent ensures accurate data entry by validating the seller's responses and self-correcting through recursive questioning when incorrect or irrelevant information is provided.

### Key Features:

#### Interactive Input Collection:
The agent asks the seller targeted questions, such as the name of the product, its price, and available quantity.

#### Input Validation:
- The agent checks whether the seller's response matches the required information (e.g., a number for price or quantity)
- If the seller provides unrelated or incorrect information, the agent explains the misunderstanding and reframes the question

#### Self-Correction and Guidance:
- The agent engages recursively, prompting the seller to correct their input when needed
- It simplifies the process by offering clear examples or explanations

#### Data Extraction for Inventory:
Once all required details are accurately collected, the agent compiles and stores the data for inventory purposes.

### Key Capabilities:
- Contextual Understanding: The agent identifies the type of information the user has provided based on their input
- Recursive Questioning: If the user provides an incorrect or irrelevant answer, the agent will reframe the question
- User-Friendly Interactions: The agent ensures the conversation remains intuitive
- Data Extraction: Once the required information is provided, the agent extracts and outputs it in the desired format

### Example Interaction:
Step-by-Step Process:
1. Initial Question: Agent: What is the price of the product?
2. User Response (Incorrect): User: It is called a red saree
3. Agent's Analysis: Recognizes that the input is a description, not the price
4. Agent's Response: Agent: It seems like you've provided the description of the product, but I need the price. Could you tell me how much it costs?
5. User Response (Corrected): User: Oh, it's for 500 rupees
6. Agent's Analysis: Identifies the correct price information in the response
7. Agent's Output: 500

### How It Works Internally:
- Input Parsing: The agent parses the user's input using natural language processing (NLP) techniques
- Entity Validation: It checks if the extracted entity matches the type of information requested
- Recursive Interaction: The agent repeats the process until it obtains the required data

## Discovery Through the Buyer App
The Indian market is as diverse as its people, making structured categorization inefficient and impractical for such a vast variety of products. To address this challenge, we have adopted an innovative approach to enhance product discovery through the buyer app.

### Our Solution: Semantic Search with Vector Embeddings

#### Description-Driven Approach:
Once a product is added, we generate a detailed AI-driven description using the data and images provided by the seller.

#### Vector Embeddings:
We create vector embeddings for each product description, capturing its semantic meaning rather than relying solely on keywords or rigid categories.

#### Cosine Similarity Search:
By leveraging cosine similarity, we enable semantic search, where the buyer can find products based on intent and context rather than exact words.

#### Adaptive Discovery:
This method allows us to overcome the inefficiencies of traditional categorization, ensuring that the diversity of products in the Indian market is fully represented and easily accessible.

## Going Forward

#### How It Works:
- Store owners can use voice commands to generate bills directly
- The system will automatically generate the bill and update inventory in real-time

### 2. Multilingual Accessibility
#### Goal: 
Make the platform universally accessible across India's diverse linguistic landscape.

#### How It Works:
- Enable sellers to interact in their preferred language
- Use real-time translation and natural language processing

### 3. Fine-Tuning Our Own AI Models
#### Goal: 
Reduce reliance on external dependencies and make the platform more cost-effective.

#### How It Works:
- Utilize user-generated data to fine-tune our own AI models
- Build a robust system optimized for specific tasks
- Benefits include lower costs and better customization

### The Road Ahead
By focusing on voice-enabled tools, language accessibility, and AI independence, we aim to create a holistic, cost-efficient, and inclusive ecosystem that empowers sellers of all scales. These initiatives align with our commitment to digitizing India's markets while keeping them rooted in their unique diversity.
